    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks implements a simple lottery scheduler simulator.  By changing the *number of time steps*, the *set of processes*, and the *number of tickets per process* (all on lines 14 through 18), one can explore how various settings for those parameters affect the generated schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running a cell\n",
    "If you click on the cell below, you can run it by hitting the *Play* button to the left of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "The output that is generated from the cell is a graph containing *time steps* on the x-axis, *percentage of CPU use* on the y-axis, with a line plot for each process."
