Then add your *hit rate* values to the list for `query_hit_rates` on line `14`, separating your values by commas (such as `query_hit_rates = [0.50,0.75]`).  Compare the answers you generated by hand to those computed by the code.\n",

Given the `tlb_lookup_time` and `memory_lookup_time` values provided on lines `7` and `8`, what is the *maximum* time that would be required to fully fetch a piece of data from memory given a logical address, and what would be the *minimum* time?  Assume the process being used is that described in the textbook and our class notes.\n",
