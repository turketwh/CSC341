    "# Operating Systems - A first metric on processes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will spend a lot of time in this class comparing design alternatives for operating system subsystems.  One way we will do that is through computing *metrics* on the perfomance of a given subsytsem.  This note highlights a simple first metric on process execution to introduce the idea of metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## *Fraction of time running* metric\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for why this metric is interesting\n",
    "\n",
    "A given process will primarily be making progress towards completion when it is in the *Running* state on a CPU.  While waiting for events to occur (such as input and output to finish) in the *Blocked* state is also productive, we will initially be interested in just the fractiom of time a process is in the *Running* state.  A metric that reports the percentage of time a process is in the *Running* state can provide insights into whether a process is *CPU-intensive* or *I/O-intensive* as well as provide some insights, when evaluated in the context of multiple processes, into the scheduling algorithms being used.  If another process is executing, a process  may spend some significant time in the *Ready* state instead of *Running*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For this metric, we'll define it as the fraction of timesteps, out of all the timesteps for which a process executed, in which a process is in the *Running* state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the state trace from the state transition diagram notes.  Each value represents the state a process was in at a given timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "New\n",
    "Ready\n",
    "Running\n",
    "Running\n",
    "Blocked\n",
    "Ready\n",
    "Running\n",
    "Running\n",
    "Exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of timesteps for which the process was present is 9.  The process is in the *Running* state for 4 of those timesteps (times 3, 4, 7, and 8, when starting counting at 1).  The fraction of time the process is in the *Running* state is 4/9, which reduces to 0.444.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python code to compute the *fraction of time running* metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is Python code to compute the *fraction of time running* metric for a state trace, where the state trace is provided as a list of strings."
