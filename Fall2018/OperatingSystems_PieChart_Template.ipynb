    "# Operating systems - Creating pie charts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the learning proficiences for this course (#5.1) is \"Generate relevant types of graphs and images using simulated and experimental data.\"  Experiences that work toward this proficiency will be embedded throughout the class.  This notebook will provide a first learning experience in this area, with the focus on making pie charts using the Python *matplotlib* library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pie charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Pie charts are a circular graphic where the circle is split into pieces, with the size of each piece corresponding with the proportion of data in the whole data set associated with that piece.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pie chart construction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a pie chart, we'll need to make use of two data sets, represented as lists.  The first list, which the code below will call *labelList*, is a set of strings representing the different subclasses (types, labels, ...) of data in the list for which we have counts.  The second list, which the code below will call *countList*, represents numerical data associated with the different subclasses.  The ordering of the lists should be the same - the first numerical value in the *countList* should be the numerical data associated with the first subclass represented in the *labelList*. The first four lines in the code in the next cell down represent example information describing how many students of four different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Freshman\n",
    "* Sophomore\n",
    "* Junior\n",
    "* Senior\n",
    "\n",
    "are enrolled in a given class.  In the example, there is 1 Freshman, 3 Sophomores, 9 Juniors, and 12 Seniors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib library\n",
    "\n",
    "*Matplotlib* is a Python library which supports the programmatic creation of figures, including line plots as well as charts such as pie charts and bar charts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More information on matplotlib can be found on its website, which can be accessed here: [https://matplotlib.org/](https://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make use of the library, we will need to import it into our program.  This is done by the 5th through 7th  line (which includes comments). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Providing values for generic plot settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can apply some generic settings to our plot.  The title is set by using the *title* function, passing in as a parameter a string.  The *axis* function allows one to manipulate how the axes are handled.  By passing in the string value *equal*, equal increments on the x-axis and y-axis have the same length when drawn.  This allow us to plot a true circle as our pie chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting the pie chart\n",
    "\n",
    "To add the actual pie chart to the graph, a call to the *pie* function is made.  The *pie* function is described in detail at this [link](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.pie.html#matplotlib.pyplot.pie). The function call header describing the *pie* function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "matplotlib.pyplot.pie(x, explode=None, labels=None, colors=None, autopct=None, pctdistance=0.6, shadow=False, labeldistance=1.1, startangle=None, radius=None, counterclock=True, wedgeprops=None, textprops=None, center=(0, 0), frame=False, rotatelabels=False, hold=None, data=None)[source]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and the description provided is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Plot a pie chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a pie chart of array x. The fractional area of each wedge is given by x/sum(x). \n",
    "If sum(x) < 1, then the values of x give the fractional area directly and the array will not be normalized. \n",
    "The resulting pie will have an empty wedge of size 1 - sum(x).\n",
    "\n",
    "The wedges are plotted counterclockwise, by default starting from the x-axis.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function description specifies that we have to pass in the numerical data as the first argument to the function.  In our case, this will be the *countList* data.  The rest of the arguments are optional and have default values if not specified. For our initial simple pie charts, we'll make use of the *labels* parameter, passing in our *labelsList* data as that argument, and the *autopct* parameter, which we'll specify as the string '%1.1f%%'.  By having this parameter set, we are indicating we want the proportional value of each pie piece to be shown, and %1.1f%% says to represent this data numerically as a percentage with one decimal place. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Showing the pie chart\n",
    "\n",
    "The different steps above generate the pie chart but don't display on the terminal/screen.  This actual plotting on the screen is done by using the *show* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code in the cell below can be done in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Click on the cell with the code you want to execute (in order to select it) and then press the *Shift* and *Enter* keys together.\n",
    "* Alternatively, go to the *Cell* menu and choose *Run cells* if you want to run only the cell you have selected, or *Run all* to run all the code cells in the document.\n",
    "* Alternatively, if you are using this notebook within mybinder.org, there is a \"play\" button just to the left of the cell which can be used to execute the code in the cell.\n",
